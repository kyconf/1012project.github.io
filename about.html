            Muhayle is a team merging the two names of both founding members: Kyle & Muhammad. It represents the unity and bond of the two as they struggle together into creating a project that can possibly benefit others for the better.<br><br>

            Guess the Flag<br><br>

The project requires the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project aims to educate while also playing as entertainment to people who are interested in vexillology- the study of flags. Guess the Flag acts as a web-based educational game that allows people of all ages to learn about countries around the world.. This website tests peopleâ€™s knowledge and guides them to find the right guess on their own via hints. This game encourages people to learn more about geography and flags, while also being presented with fun facts about them.
